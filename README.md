## ancillary

Other orgs to review: Goehackweek, cloudmaven, pangeo, haciendata, cormorack, whaledr, research2cloud, escience-pangeo, and cloudbank-project


This should go into POETs repo: 


* [make a Python environment self-configurable...](http://github.com/robfatland/ops)
  * Can use `environment.yml` or `requirements.txt`
    * The latter is associated with `pip install` and can be made a sub-component of the former
    * `environment.yml` as follows
      * `conda env export` produces `environment.yml`
    * `requirements.txt` as follows
      * Create a virtual environment `python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/env`
      * Install packages using `pip install <package>`
      * Save all packages `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
      * "Pin all the package versions"... not sure what the action is or what this means
      * Move `requirements.txt` to the root directory of the project

* [Dog Aging Project](http://dogagingproject.com/)

factor in: 

* [High Mountain Asia](http://himat.org/) and 
[our ++](https://cloudmaven.github.io/documentation/ccs_high_mountain_asia.html)

* [Data8 / Jupyter classrooms](http://data8.org/), also [Zero2JHub](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
