## Overview

I'd like to get to V10 boulder problems but the grade chase is not the thing. The thing 
is volume (lots of climbs) and the parts that are difficult.

Additional for the gym: Levers and other bar variants; road cardio; swimming and rowing.
Mitbo has great ideas in a 'training w/out climbing' video. Some activation choices like 
climbing the stairs, commute to the bus by bike. Free weight work.  



### how many calories in a dove milk chocolate? 


Answer: 30. So I just had 120 calories. Worth it.


### useful ideas

- Satiety ('feeling full') is a combination of real body stimulus and perception
  - Perception and habit are *trained*
- Nutrition includes complex carbs, vegetables, fat and protein
  - Each has good and bad variants... although vegetables are generally just good
- The *invisibility* principle: 'There are invisible forces working against you; all based in your head'
  - Fitness program people are doing a *job* whereas the acolyte's very *life* is at stake
- Deep motivation is difficult to organize but effective 
  - Passive and reactive habits take years of reps to re-train
  - Having a psychological reward in place for good choices
- Nutrition mechanics are like driving a car...
  - Day to day is pretty simple
  - Neglected details wear the parts down. Regular oil changes, brown rice. 


### bullets that work for me

Sustainability elements...

1. Exercise... climbing, supportive work (cardio, hand, resistance, core, ...), mobility work
2. Breakfast as fixed event
3. Protein
4. Daily weigh-in
5. Moderate carbs to less less less less; substituting more 0 carbs
6. Resistance training progression: Resist more not more reps
7. Setbacks happen; white knuckle problem. Embrace white knuckles... but with what?
8. Weekend deviation, alcohol, chocolate
9. Hydrate... what does that mean?
10. Sleep enough
11. Control stress
12. External support system
13. Food tracker: not at this point
14. Repeat: Veggies: Nutrients for nothing and your Satiety for free
15. Foolish consistency is apparently the hobgoblin of little minds
16. Mindful eating: What does a yellow light mean?
17. Realistic sustainable changes: Don't make any changes that are not permanent
18. Consistent meditation on the process on a daily basis
19. Identify points of failure, usually Empty Carbs of Opportunity (ECOs)  
  - This ***never*** feels like a solved problem; at best a narrow escape
20. Mostly-stopped drinking has helped... "One glass of vin: The brownies flow in"
21. Walking the pattern as a reward is very motivating
22. Seaweed and sunflower kernels and Gu stopgaps

### health versus BMI

To avoid 'this time around' once and for good the expression is *problem worked on*, not *goal reached*. 
A precipitating event (thanks dad) has emphasized this reframe: He was 28 when I was born. Is a 28-year 
countdown clock ticking now? 


I hope health is related to joy in living as a virtuous cycle. Otherwise the
engines of self-destruction churn away below street level. 


I started this in early
August 2018 with a symptomatic mindset but I'm happy to modify the symptom.
I began with "100% diet, no exercise" and the weight metric. 
The nice thing about putting a dent in that is how it opens activity doors. 


'Use it or lose it' kept playing somewhere in the back of my mind... but only as sloshing gasoline... 
SBP was the match; now maybe I can go up a V2.  


### the sub-problem

One day I realized I had an obstacle in my way. Thought about this and realized that the
word *obstacle* reinforces itself. So...


An *obstacle* is not an *obstacle*; it is a solvable problem. Obstacles are eventually ignored and 
they become invisible; so they do not go away. Invisible hindrances are no trouble at all provided
you are good with living in that prison.
*Obstacle as problem* is more difficult. 
Gaze at a *perceived* obstacle and ask over and over "What is the real problem backing this perception?"
This task -- identifying the *actual* obstacle -- leads to framing a solvable problem. Turning an
impossible obstacle into an actively solvable problem is the ***sub-problem***. Sub-problem skill is
a grand skill. I often marvel at how bad I am at sub-problems after I accidentally
discover or even solve one.

The example here: I don't want to go lift weights at the gym because -- although I know it is good 
for my health -- it just doesn't sound fun at the moment; so yeah use it or lose it but not today. The perceived
obstacle is 'get to the gym to lift weights cause it is good for you'. Sub-problem thinking: 'Get to the gym to
lift' is not the actual problem. What is the actual problem? What is the actual problem?? Oh... the actual 
problem is 'Going to the gym has gotten boring so I need to find a motivating physical activity, something fun.' 
And by accidentally doing *that*... 


### Friction and Fraction


Taking the health problem as *large* it must be amenable to a *large* solution. This is ***False***. 


Why is it False? Because this final time around a large solution 
is getting fractionated into many many small pieces. 17 keys to success? I need at least 429
keys. I still put sugar in my morning coffee... there's a key. 
Fractionation through self-reflection. 


I cannot
hope to simply contravene ingrained habit, certainly not all at once. 
Perhaps I *can* create little
bits of resistance to try and slow down the habit. Slow a freight train with many q-tips. 
If there is a world made real 
by thought (for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so) then my thought solution is 
to create so many Q-tip frictions slowing my habits that eventually measurable changes emerge. 
Thinking makes it so.


### Daily weigh in 

Every day I walk a pattern along numbered parking spots. I
start at my starting weight and walk down the numbers to arrive at my weight 
as measured that morning. 
I often miss a bus to finish this ritual. I imagine the pounds lifting
off as I walk. The habit of the ceremony helps me focus. Geek Climber recommends we
treat holds like lightbulbs and be surprised at how little force is required
to stay on the wall. 


### climbing 

How many cookies does one wish to bring up the problem? Leave them on the mat. 
With 28 years left: At 3/4 the mass I get another 7 years here.  Or more. 


### lament

* Nobody ever lost so much as an ounce of weight by passing up a cookie
* I failed to eat a thousand cookies but lost no weight...
* ...rather was simply 1000 cookies sadder
* I should eat 1000 cookies
* And die young and happy, full of cookies
* I don't want to die young and happy 
* So... I must kill all the versions of myself who die young and happy
* Myself young, happy and full of cookies has carried around a sixty pound sack of rocks, poor fellow
* He did not complain
* He smiled a great deal and made jokes; and he tried to contribute to the world
* He was an honorable fellow... and I am killing him
* I mourn his loss, I mourn the loss of this poor fellow myself-full-of-cookies
* If it becomes unbearable... I can bring him back to life
* ...by eating a cookie
