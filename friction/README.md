Notes for a future self on health. 

## Overview

Nobody needs another weight loss book but I do benefit from multiple sources on Youtube rock climbing videos; so 
if this has relevance as such: So much the better. But this is written by me for me: On how I lost 60 pounds and
got healthy without ever eating a salad. In fact this README was started when I was down 27 pounds of 60; but having
hit the light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel moment realizing I'm going to get there it is time to start thinking about
sustainability. 

## Notes

Let's start with fitness programs, pro and con.

- Gym X Fitness Program Y makes two good points that are worth internalizing
  - Satiety or 'feeling full' is a combination of real body stimulus and perception
    - Perception has to be trained
  - Nutrition includes complex carbs, zero-cal vegetables, fat, and protein
    - For each category there are good and bad versions of stuff
- Gym X Fitness Program Y also provides a self-defeating 'invisible' principle
  - Not to fault them but the fitness program people are in it for the money. It is a business; this is fine. 
  - Thinking that they somehow care is putting eggs in an Illusion Basket
    - The problem comes when the program ends *if my behavior is predicated on their support/caring*

Many other useful ideas come out of Gym X Fitness Program Y
