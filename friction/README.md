## Overview

I do benefit from multiple sources on Youtube; for example rock climbing videos each have some value. Usually. 
So perhaps this has some value as a data point. Any case the idea is to evaluate ideas from other sources... 
after some core dump reflection. 


## Begin at X, go to Y, currently at Z where Y < Z < X

With **Z** looking encouraging I look ahead to the *sustain* problem: **<= Y**. 


### fitness pro and con.

- Gym P Fitness Program T: Emphasizes two useful ideas
  - Satiety ('feeling full') is a combination of real body stimulus and perception
    - Perception has to be trained
  - Nutrition includes complex carbs, vegetables, fat, and protein
    - For each category there are good and bad versions... except vegetables which are just good
- Gym P Fitness Program T also provides a self-defeating 'invisible' principle
  - Fitness program people are in it for the money, obviously...
  - So thinking that they *care* (beyond politess) is not a business plan for sustainable health
    - ...unless one has considerable wealth
    - ...hence my healthy behavior has to rest on sterner foundations

Many other useful ideas come out of Gym P Fitness Program T so two further principles before 
I move on.

Firstly surface motivation is easy and ineffectual whereas deep motivation is difficult and effective. 
This must be internal, trained and habituated. From observation: Passive and reactive habits take years
of repetitions to re-train. 

Secondly: The mechanics of nutrition are about as complicated as a car. Not dead 
simple, not rocket science, somewhere in between. The day-to-day operation is pretty simple in fact 
but if details are neglected (like say regular oil changes or brown rice over white) it is going to 
cut down on how long the car lasts. 

### intermezzo on what works

Sustainability websites abound; so here is a 17-element listing of what works from healthline. Numbers
in paren are my degree of self-emphasis (averaging 'in practice' and 'my theoretical approach') on 1-10. 
Odds of successfully making a permanent change are 1 in 5. 

1. Exercise (10) Climbing, sailing
2. Breakfast (10) Need to add a vegetable...
3. Protein (8) Cheat towards salmon
4. Weigh yourself (10) Daily
5. Moderate carbs (7) less less less less
6. Lift (10) A motivating context is necessary, see Exercise
7. Setbacks happen (5) Resonates with the white knuckle problem
8. Don't weekend-deviate (8) Alcohol in particular is kryptonite
9. Hydrate (6) Does coffee count?
10. Enough sleep (10) And regular hours
11. Control stress (7) How?
12. External support system (3) 
13. Food tracker (4) I prefer to meditate
14. Veggies (10) Nutrients for nothing and your Satiety for free
15. Consistency (10) Though recalling that foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds
16. Mindful eating (9) 'What does a yellow light mean?'
17. Realistic sustainable changes (10) Motivating this write-up

What is missing from this list for me is consistent meditation on the process -- daily basis -- and 
identification of points of failure in that meditation. For example I am frequently in improvisational situations with
regard to calories-in. Open boxes of donuts abound; and even successfully refusing Empty Carbs of Opportunity (ECOs) 
never feels like a solved problem. *Maybe* these refusals are getting a bit habituated after 3/4 of a year of repetitions.
Stopping drinking mostly has helped a lot as well. After a small glass of wine brownies just flow into my hand as if by magic.


Ok onward. 


### health versus BMI

Writing this up intends to avoid 'this time around' syndrome. It would be very 
pleasant to solve health once and for good. *Solved* in contrast to *goal reached*. 
As Cerebus remarks: The novelty of being dropped on your head wears thin
in a hurry. The novelty of reaching a goal *temporarily* has worn thin, particularly
the white knuckle feeling of holding a precarious perch. Fortunately
a precipitating event re-frames *goal* thinking as *solved* thinking. This was my dad dying. 
He was 28 when I was born. Did a 28 year countdown clock start ticking?
Am I Bellairs' house? I suppose the answer is 'yes unless' so welcome, future self, to ***unless***.


I think health is related to a joy in living as a virtuous cycle. Thinking this is so but then failing
to live that way is a self-swindle: I'm kidding myself to keep a surface level of 
equanimity while engines of self-destruction churn away below street level. There is a larger 
problem here and health is symptomatic. But just as I started this with a symptomatic 
mindset (weight loss, not health gain) I'm happy to change the symptom (health gain, not
joy in living) in the hope that I'm moving towards sorting that big one out. 


### misguided tactics 


To reiterate: 'Weight is health' is a good proxie but it's not completely accurate. BMI is a symptom; and 
not all who sniffle have colds. But: better to start under inaccurate motivations than not start out. I also started 
out with the idea that weight loss is 90%+ from diet and 10%- from exercise. On prior trips around this loop exercise 
was the lead dog, doing the 90% heavy lifting.  This time I began with "100% diet, no exercise". The start day after a 
year of false starts was August 3 2018.


Over the first 3/4 year my mindset changed from weight loser to a health manager; but that transition is not done. 
The phrase 'Use it or lose it' kept playing somewhere in the back of my mind... but only as sloshing gasoline... 
Then one winter day a playdate at the Seattle Boulder Project obliged me to rent some tight-fitting shoes and a 
chalk bag and I wandered about and managed a couple of VBs (most basic climbs). That was the match.  


### the sub-problem


The most important bit of self-advice here: Don't treat 
an *obstacle* as an obstacle because you habitually dismiss obstacles that have no obvious solution.
The obstacle disappears from view, becomes an *invisible* obstacle. 


Rather: Treat an obstacle as a problem. It is an active challenge to solve it. This absolutely requires looking
at a *perceived* obstacle and asking over and over again "What is the real obstacle behind this perception?"
This task -- identifying the *actual* obstacle -- leads to framing a solvable problem. Turning an
impossible obstacle into an actively solvable problem is the ***sub-problem***. Sub-problem skill is
the grandest of all skills to develop. I often marvel at how bad I am at sub-problems after I accidentally
solve one.

The example here: I don't want to go lift weights at the gym because -- although I know it is good 
for my health -- it just doesn't sound fun at the moment; so yeah use it or lose it but not today. The perceived
obstacle is 'get to the gym to lift weights cause it is good for you'. Sub-problem thinking: 'Get to the gym to
lift' is not the actual problem. What is the actual problem? What is the actual problem?? Oh... the actual 
problem is 'Find an activity that is fun'. And by accidentally doing *that*...




### Friction and Fraction


Taking the health problem as *large* it must be amenable to a *large* solution. This is ***False***. 


Why is it False? Because it's me. The approach this final time around is a large solution 
fractionated into many many small pieces. 17 keys to success? Don't make me laugh; I need at least 429
of them, each key to be sub-fractionated into a score: How well am I doing with this small key? 
For example reducing sugar consumption is a fractional goal but I still put sugar in my morning coffee. 
Fractionation through self-reflection. 


Friction acts against motion. The habits I have to change are so ingrained that I cannot
hope to simply contravene them, certainly not all at once. The best I could hope for would be to create little
bits of resistance to try and slow down the habit. Slow a freight train with a Q-tip. 
But there is no end to the supply of Q-tips for an imaginative soul. If there is a world made real 
by thought (for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so) then my thought solution is 
to create so many Q-tip frictions slowing my habits that eventually measurable changes will appear. 
Thinking makes it so.


### Daily weigh in 


In the dreadful fantasy series 'Chronicles of Amber' Zelazny describes a pattern drawn on the ground. 
It is like a chalk path drawn on parking lot asphalt. One must 'walk the pattern'. Doing so is 
a magical and difficult procedure. But nce through one is rejuvenated to teleport to the next story. 


Every day I walk my pattern along numbered parking spots. I
start at my starting weight X and walk down the numbers to arrive at my weight today Z 
as measured that morning. 
I often miss the next bus to finish. I imagine the (X-Z) pounds lifting
off as I walk, one of several time set-asides each day to live inside health as process. 
This helps dispel a white knuckle feeling of irrational despair. I look at the big 
project and unable to solve it want to move on to a serving of chocolate cake please. 
No, I will take the habit of the ceremony and let the hands relax. Geek Climber says to 
treat the holds like lightbulbs and be surprised at how little force is required
to stay on the wall. 


### Once and for good


Here I need to find the sub-problem. Shout out to the un-found sub-problem. 


I do not know the way to changing *goal* to *solved*. 


ohhhhhh maybe i found it without realizing it. Maybe the thing is internalizing sub-problem thinking. 
Bit of a logical land mine but I will think more about this. 

### climbing 

I need core and flexibility. And to be lighter because how many cookies does one wish to bring up 
the problem? With 28 years left: Going to 3/4 the mass -- a healthy mass -- I get another 7 years 
here.  However I choose to think of it as nonlinear in my favor. I get forever. 


### lament

* I never lost so much as an ounce of weight by passing up a cookie
* Therefore when I failed to eat a thousand cookies I lost no weight...
* ...but rather was just 1000 cookies sadder
* Therefore I should eat 1000 cookies
* And so die young and happy, full of cookies
* I don't want to die young and happy 
* So I must kill the version of myself who dies young and happy so he can't die young and happy
* That version of myself young, happy and full of cookies carried around a weight of (X-Y) pounds, poor fellow
* He did not complain about this
* In fact he smiled a lot of the time and he made jokes and he tried to contribute to the world
* He was an honorable fellow... and now I contemplate having killed him
* I mourn his loss, I mourn the loss of this poor fellow myself-full-of-cookies
* If it becomes unbearable I can bring him back to life simply by eating a cookie
* Meanwhile he has been replaced by a chap carrying around (Z-Y) extra pounds...
* ...whom I must kill and replace, kill and replace, until Z = Y
* ...halfway there...
