# friction

Notes for my future self on healf. To cut to the chase see the 
[**sub-problem**](https://github.com/robfatland/ops/blob/master/friction/README.md/the_sub-problem) section below.

## Overview

I do benefit from multiple sources on Youtube; for example rock climbing videos each have some value. Usually. 
So perhaps this has some value as a data point. Any case I can aggregate ideas from other sources... but
before I: Some reflection: By me for me. 
I started this writeup at 27 pounds down in a plan to lose 60 *and get healthy otherwise actually* in the process. 
I have not yet solved the 'sustain' problem. The plan 
of this README is to first outline my current state of thinking, then collect external
information, then write out a synthesis on sustaining health.

## Current state of thinking

Let's start with *prior input* and *reflections* on becoming and staying healthy.

### fitness program: pro and con.

- Gym X Fitness Program Y makes two good points that are worth internalizing
  - Satiety or 'feeling full' is a combination of real body stimulus and perception
    - Perception has to be trained
  - Nutrition includes complex carbs, vegetables, fat, and protein
    - For each category there are good and bad versions
- Gym X Fitness Program Y also provides a self-defeating 'invisible' principle
  - Not to fault them but the fitness program people are in it for the money. It is a business; of course! 
  - Thinking that they care (beyond at a polite level) puts my eggs in an Illusion Basket
    - The problem comes when the program ends *if my healthy behavior is predicated on them caring*

Many other useful ideas come out of Gym X Fitness Program Y but mainly: Surface motivation is easy
and ineffectual; and deep motivation is difficult. It can't come from an external
point of origin. Second point: The mechanics of nutrition are about as complicated as a car. Not dead 
simple, not rocket science, somewhere in between. The day-to-day operation is pretty simple in fact 
but if details are neglected (like say regular oil changes or brown rice over white) it is going to 
cut down on how long the car lasts. 

### health versus BMI

The primary goal of this exercise -- writing this up -- is to avoid 'this time around'. It would be very 
pleasant to solve my health once and for good. That is: *Solved* in contrast to *goal reached*. 
The notes here identify solved as a change from 'this time around' to 'this is the last time 
around'; because as Cerebus says the novelty of being dropped on your head wears thin
in a hurry. The novelty of getting to a goal *temporarily* has really worn thin. Fortunately I did have
a precipitating event to help me try and re-frame from *goal* to *solved*. This event was my dad dying. 
He was 28 when I was born. Did a 28 year countdown clock start ticking the day he passed away? 
I suppose the answer is 'yes unless' so welcome dear future self to ***unless***.


I think health is related to joy of being alive in a virtuous cycle. Thinking this is so but then failing
to live that way is a self bait-and-switch. 'Yeah obviously but today I just don't have time to eat healthy.'

Another bait-and-switch is the idea that weight is health. Or BMI is health.  And permit me to remind you,
dear future self, that this time around (this *last* time around) you began with just that idea. 
'Healthy' was the lip service, weight was the reified read-out... and that is actually just fine. Better to
start under unresolved motivation than not start out. 

I also started out with the idea that weight loss is 90%+ from diet and 10%- from exercise. 
On prior trips around the loss/gain cycle I used exercise as the lead dog, the 90%.  This time I began with
"it has to be 100% diet". The start day was August 3 2018.


The process began very *gradually* and over the first nine months my mindset has changed from weight loser
to a more complete mindset of health manager. Before this change: The phrase 'Use it or lose it' kept playing somewhere 
in the back of my mind... but it was only sloshing gasoline, no match... and I didn't worry too much about the 
dearth of matches. Then one winter day the child had a playdate at the Seattle Boulder Project so I rented 
some tight shoes and a chalk bag and wandered in so as to keep tabs on her. 


Match. 


### the sub-problem

This is probably the most important idea here. Buried down seven sub-sections deep... anyway: Don't treat 
an obstacle as an obstacle because it will disappear from view and become an invisible obstacle. Treat an
obstacle as an active challenge so that you can solve it. The task of identifying the *actual* obstacle
and figuring out how to make it an active solvable problem is the ***sub-problem***. Sub-problem skill is
the grandest of all skills to develop. I often marvel at how bad I am at sub-problems after I accidentally
solve one.

### Friction and Fraction

Taking the health problem as *large* it must be amenable to a *large* solution. This is ***False***. 

Why is it False? Because it's me. The approach this final time around is to create a large solution that 
is fractionated into many many small pieces. Each of these pieces is then sub-fractionated into a score, 
say on a scale of 10: How well am I doing with a small piece? For example reducing raw sugar consumption is 
a fractional goal but I still put sugar in my morning coffee. So I do not get a 10 score on that yet. 
Writing this out is another fractional task, part of self-reflection. 


Friction acts against motion to constrain it. The habits I have to change are so ingrained that I realized I could
not hope to simply contravene them, certainly not all at once. The best I could hope for would be to create little
bits of resistance to try and slow down the habit. It often feels like trying to slow a freight train with a Q-tip. 
But there is no end to the supply of Q-tips to an imaginative soul. If there is a second world that is made real 
by thinking (and thinking makes it so) then my imagined solution is to create so many Q-tip efforts at frictionalizing
my habits that eventually measurable changes will appear. 


### Daily attention


In the rather dreadful 'Chronicles of Amber' Zelazny designs a pattern that a lead character must walk. It is 
magical and very difficult. But once he gets through it he is revived and can teleport anywhere he likes. 


Every day I get to the Park-N-Ride and walk my own pattern: Of parking spaces that are numbered from where
my weight started to where it is on that day. I often miss my bus in favor of the next one in order to complete
walking the pattern. 

### Once and for good


### lament

* I never lost a single ounce of weight by failing to eat a cookie
* By extension if I fail to eat a thousand cookies I lose no weight. I'm just 1000 cookies sad.
