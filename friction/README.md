Notes for my future self on health 

## Overview

Nobody needs another weight loss book but I do benefit from multiple sources on Youtube rock climbing videos; so 
if this has relevance as such: So much the better. But this is written by me for me: On how I lost 60 pounds and
got healthy without ever eating a salad. In fact this README was started when I was down 27 pounds of 60; but having
hit the light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel moment realizing I'm going to get there it is time to start thinking about
sustainability. 

## Notes

Let's start with a set of 'inputs' around the basic task of becoming and staying healthy.

### fitness programs, pro and con.

- Gym X Fitness Program Y makes two good points that are worth internalizing
  - Satiety or 'feeling full' is a combination of real body stimulus and perception
    - Perception has to be trained
  - Nutrition includes complex carbs, zero-cal vegetables, fat, and protein
    - For each category there are good and bad versions of stuff
- Gym X Fitness Program Y also provides a self-defeating 'invisible' principle
  - Not to fault them but the fitness program people are in it for the money. It is a business; this is fine. 
  - Thinking that they somehow care is putting eggs in an Illusion Basket
    - The problem comes when the program ends *if my behavior is predicated on their support/caring*

Many other useful ideas come out of Gym X Fitness Program Y. The main takeaways from the above notes: First
it is easy for me to have surface motivation and deep motivation is difficult; it can't come from an external
point of origin. Second the mechanics of nutrition are about as complicated as a car. Not dead simple, not
rocket science, somewhere in between. The day-to-day operation is pretty simple in fact but if I neglect the
details (like regular oil changes and brown rice in preference to white rice) it is going to cut down on 
how long the car lasts. 

### health versus BMI

The primary goal of this exercise -- writing this up -- is to avoid 'this time around'. It would be very 
pleasant to solve my health once and for good. The notes here will identify 'this time around' with the
idea that it is the last time around. As Cerebus says 'The novelty of being dropped on your head wears thin
in a hurry.' The novelty of getting to a goal... temporarily... has really worn thin. Fortunately I did have
a precipitating event to help me try and re-frame the idea of a goal. This event was: My dad died. He was 28
when I was born. Did the clock start a 28 year countdown the day he passed away? 

Health is related to joy of being alive in a virtuous cycle. Another bait-and-switch is the idea that weight 
is health. Or BMI is health.  And permit me to remind you -- future self -- that 'this time around' you began
with just that idea. 

### Once and for good
