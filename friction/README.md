Notes for my future self on health 

## Overview

I do benefit from multiple sources on Youtube; for example rock climbing videos each have some value. Usually. 
Before collecting sources here I will write out my thinking: By me for me. 
I started this at 27 pounds down in a plan to lose 60 *and get healthy otherwise* in the process. 
Motivation is the idea that I have not yet solved the 'sustain' problem. The plan 
of this README is to first outline my current state of thinking, then to collect some external
information, then to write out a synthesis to sustain the state of health I am traveling towards.

## Current state of thinking

Let's start with a set of 'inputs' around the basic task of becoming and staying healthy.

### fitness program: pro and con.

- Gym X Fitness Program Y makes two good points that are worth internalizing
  - Satiety or 'feeling full' is a combination of real body stimulus and perception
    - Perception has to be trained
  - Nutrition includes complex carbs, zero-cal vegetables, fat, and protein
    - For each category there are good and bad versions of stuff
- Gym X Fitness Program Y also provides a self-defeating 'invisible' principle
  - Not to fault them but the fitness program people are in it for the money. It is a business; this is fine. 
  - Thinking that they somehow care is putting eggs in an Illusion Basket
    - The problem comes when the program ends *if my behavior is predicated on their support/caring*

Many other useful ideas come out of Gym X Fitness Program Y but the main takeaways from the above notes: First
it is easy for me to have surface motivation and yet deep motivation is difficult; it can't come from an external
point of origin. Second the mechanics of nutrition are about as complicated as a car. Not dead simple, not
rocket science, somewhere in between. The day-to-day operation is pretty simple in fact but if I neglect the
details (like regular oil changes and brown rice in preference to white rice) it is going to cut down on 
how long the car lasts. 

### health versus BMI

The primary goal of this exercise -- writing this up -- is to avoid 'this time around'. It would be very 
pleasant to solve my health once and for good. The notes here identify 'this time around' as the last time 
around; because as Cerebus says 'The novelty of being dropped on your head wears thin
in a hurry.' The novelty of getting to a goal... temporarily... has really worn thin. Fortunately I did have
a precipitating event to help me try and re-frame the idea of a goal. This event was: My dad died. He was 28
when I was born. Did the clock start a 28 year countdown the day he passed away? Let's suppose the answer
is 'yes unless'. Welcome dear future self to unless.

I think health is related to joy of being alive in a virtuous cycle. Another bait-and-switch is the idea that weight 
is health. Or BMI is health.  And permit me to remind you future self that 'this time around' you began
with just that idea. 'Healthy' was just lip service, weight was the read-out on reification. This was supported
by the idea that weight loss is 90% diet and 10% exercise. Based on prior trips around the cycle where exercise 
was the leading mindset: You decided this time it would be 100% diet. That started after a startling scale reading
on August 3 2018. 

Fortunately this delusion started the process off *gradually* so that I grew from my role of weight loser
into the more complete role of health manager. The phrase 'use it or lose it' kept playing somewhere in the
back of my mind... but this was just some gasoline. Needed a match... but I didn't worry too much about the 
dearth of matches. And then one winter day the child had a play date at the Seattle Boulder Project so I rented 
shoes and a chalk bag so as to keep tabs on her. Match. 

### the sub-problem

This is probably the most important idea here. Buried down seven sub-sections deep... anyway: Don't treat 
an obstacle as an obstacle because it will disappear from view and become an invisible obstacle. Treat an
obstacle as an active challenge so that you can solve it. The task of identifying the *actual* obstacle
and figuring out how to make it an active solvable problem is the ***sub-problem***. sub-problem skill is
the grandest of all skills to develop. I often marvel at how bad I am at sub-problems after I accidentally
solve one.

### Friction and Fraction

Taking the health problem as *large* it must be amenable to a *large* solution. This is ***False***. 

Why is it False? Because it's me. The approach this final time around is to create a large solution that is fractionated
into many many small pieces, like a hundred. Each of these pieces is then sub-fractionated into a score, 
say on a scale of 10: How well am I doing with that small piece? For example reducing raw sugar consumption is 
a fractional goal but I still put sugar in my morning coffee. So I do not get a 10 score on that yet. 
Writing this out is another fractional task, part of a self-reflection process. 


Friction acts against motion to constrain it. The habits I have to change are so ingrained that I realized I could
not hope to simply contravene them, certainly not all at once. The best I could hope for would be to create little
bits of resistance to try and slow down the habit. It often feels like trying to slow a freight train with a Q-tip. 
But there is no end to the supply of Q-tips to an imaginative soul. If there is a second world that is made real 
by thinking (and thinking makes it so) then my imagined solution is to create so many Q-tip efforts at frictionalizing
my habits that eventually measurable changes will appear. 



### Once and for good
