# Time Travel Story

It began one day in the book stalls along the Seine. The Bouquinistes, I should say; it is better to speak in French
when you can, when there are special words; they are always more beautiful. In fact it began earlier though, *plus 
t&#244;t*. It began in the Louvre as I walked from gallery to the next, walking through time, wishing that I understood
why these paintings were here. Were they all that survived from 1647? Or was there merit? Was there a story behind them?
As I walked through the crowds, growing ever more disenchanted, a word from my school days made its way through 
the dingy and vast network of neurons that is my brain onto center stage: 'Criticism'. I needed a criticism... which is
(I thought) the scholarly term for 'Explanation'. It lingered there, that word, just long enough to leave a little 
imprint in my memory... and so as I walked among the Bouquinistes glancing at titles on spines and covers, I saw at 
some remove the title 'Une critique des premières œuvres de da Vinci'. A moment later it was in my hand, and flipping 
through a few pages finding words, words, words, and then 4 francs lighter it rested in my backpack. I would wring from this little 
book the reason at last: Why I should care, about all these long-dead people in these ancient frames on these celebrated
ancient walls of the Palais du Louvre?
