# Time Travel Story

For Boom...

It began one day on the left bank of the 'only river that runs between two bookshelves'. 
The Bouquinistes--we use the beautiful French words when can--but really it began earlier (*plus t&#244;t*)
in the Louvre as I walked
the galleries, walked in time, wondering
why these paintings were here, what they meant, the stories behind such places of honor. 
Were they simply here by virtue of having survived four centuries of rasping wear?


As I walked through the crowds, growing more disenchanted, a word from my school days made its way through 
the dingy and vast network of my brain: 'Criticism'. I needed a criticism... a scholarly word for 'Explanation'. 
It lingered there, that word, long enough to leave a little 
print in my memory... and so as I walked among the Bouquinistes glancing at titles on spines and covers, I saw at 
some remove the title 'Une critique des premières oeuvres da Vinci'... and the memory flared. A moment later 
the book was in my hand, and me flipping pages, finding words, words, words, and so 4 francs lighter it came to rest
in my backpack. I would wring from this little 
book the reason at last for an arm load of those paintings. Why I should care? For all these long-dead people 
in these ancient frames on those celebrated, enshrined, ancient walls of the Palais du Louvre... what was 
so ... about da Vinci's early works?
