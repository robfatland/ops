# Time Travel Story

It began one day in the book stalls along the Seine, the 'only river that runs between two bookshelves'. 
The Bouquinistes, I should say; it is better to speak in French when you can, when there are special words; they are 
always more beautiful. In fact it began earlier though, *plus t&#244;t*. It began in the Louvre as I walked among
the galleries, walking through time, wishing that I understood
why these paintings were here, what they meant, in these places of honor. Were they simply the only paintings that
had survived the 1600s? Was there a story behind them?


As I walked through the crowds, growing more disenchanted, a word from my school days made its way through 
the dingy and vast network of my brain: 'Criticism'. I needed a criticism... a scholarly word for 'Explanation'. 
It lingered there, that word, long enough to leave a little 
print in my memory... and so as I walked among the Bouquinistes glancing at titles on spines and covers, I saw at 
some remove the title 'Une critique des premi√®res oeuvres da Vinci'... and the memory flared. A moment later 
the book was in my hand, and me flipping pages, finding words, words, words, and so 4 francs lighter it came to rest
in my backpack. I would wring from this little 
book the reason at last for an arm load of those paintings. Why I should care? For all these long-dead people 
in these ancient frames on those celebrated, enshrined, ancient walls of the Palais du Louvre... what was 
so ... about da Vinci's early works?
