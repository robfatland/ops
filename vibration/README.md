# Cubase projects

## ***Born To Produce*** Beginner Tutorial 

* Project name is btpbeginnertutorial
* Note the similarity in Jay's accent to that of Graham Chapman in the Ethel The Frog sketch ("My name's not Clement.")


### Review perfunctories / accelerators until second nature


* Before proceeding with the project check...
  * ...VST Studio in Studio: Ensure correct driver is selected
  * Project Setup 44.1khz, bit depth = 16 (it was at 24 for some reason)
  * Set the project length at UL to anticipate how long we expect
* Keyboard shortcuts 
  * shift + left to set track color
    * drums are green, production tracks are different green; kbd red; bass yellow
  * shift B/N for start/end of loop
    * Select event and alt + p sets the loop on that precise event and starts playback
      * p by itself, no alt, resets the loop range to the currently selected event
  * Move cycle markers: ctrl - left / alt - left (don't go scanning for them!)
  * alt = draw tool or cut tool based on context (outside / inside event)
  
  
Chord Pad
* Use monitor button on an Instrument track to hear chords even when track is de-selected
