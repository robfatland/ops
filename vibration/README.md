## Born To Produce Beginner Tutorial 

* btpbeginnertutorial
* Note the similarity in Jay's accent to that of Graham Chapman in the Ethel The Frog sketch ("My name's not Clement.")

### Review perfunctories / accelerators until second nature

* Before proceeding with the project check...
  * ...VST Studio in Studio: Ensure correct driver is selected
  * Project Setup 44.1khz, bit depth = 16 (it was at 24 for some reason)
  * Set the project length at UL to anticipate how long we expect
* Keyboard shortcuts 
  * shift + left to set track color
    * drums are green, production tracks are different green; kbd red; bass yellow
  * shift B/N for start/end of loop
  * Move cycle markers: ctrl - left / alt - left (don't go scanning for them!)
