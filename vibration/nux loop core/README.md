# nu>x loop core


Operations manual for people who learn by writing stuff out for their damn selves.


## **Process of elimination** persepective

Let's do away with all the obvious stuff and in the next section focus on confusion.

- Dispense with the concentric volume knobs: Two knobs, two functions, end of story
- Dispense with v ^ as chooser controls in any given menu, end of story
- There are now five controls to figure out plus...
    - display interpretation...
    - mode lights
    - Power On `configuration` access
        - Order of footswitch modes Play / Record / Overdub: Footswitch + Power
        - Factory Reset: Same as previous then hold down v 2 seconds: See F0, tap Footswitch to confirm
        - Frequency compensation function??? Save/Delete + Power
    - USB connector for `.WAV` file transfer in a numbered track sub-folder of `looper24` folder
    - Audio in jack
- 'Hold X' means you hold button X down for 2 seconds, e.g. *hold Footswitch*
- 'Tap X' is just that, in contrast to 'Hold X'


## **Those five controls** perspective


- RHYTHM (default: metronome) button: tap on/off
    - This is *independent* of the phrase loop recording
    - Can turn this on with a tap or by a double-tap of an activated (lit) TAP TEMPO button
    - Default metronome 4/4; hold TAP TEMPO to get into 3/4 vs 4/4 option, v ^ to choose
- TAP TEMPO is only active when lit
    - Two taps is enough to establish a tempo; can keep tapping to get to whatever groove if you like
    - Hold TAP TEMPO to get choice of 3/4 vs 4/4
- Foot switch
    - Double tap is "STOP" playback / record / overdub... sort of
    - Single tap moves from Stop > Record > Play > Overdub > Play > Overdub > Play > etcetera
        - See Power On section above on changing this order
- Stop Modes
    - Tap: cycle through Stop / Stop-at-end-of-phrase / Stop after 10 second fadeout
        - Latter two of these take time to stop
            - During wind-down: LED will flash
            - When LED flashes: Tap footswitch for immediate stop
    - Hold STOP to engage Auto-record (tap confirm)
        - Once engaged (`rA`) unit is in standby, not record mode
        - Footswitch to arm recording: Record LED flashing
        - Strong input signal triggers start recording
            - Under *some* conditions this start event also starts the rhythm track
- SAVE / DELETE
    - Tap to Save: Decimal point lights indicating data in numerical track
    - Display alternates track number and `SA`
        - (Terms: Numerical track = Loop = Memory number = recording track 1-99 = ...)
    - Tap to confirm. Save time is quite long.
    
## **What I want to do** perspective

- Access 40 rhythm tracks
    - Seems to be 20 under 4/4 time and 20 under 3/3: Hold TAP TEMPO to switch between these
- Activate TAP TEMPO
    - ?
    - Seems to be inactive sometimes; but bounching v ^ on channel seems to bring it back
- Get rid of stuff: UNDO, CLEAR, DELETE, v^Bounce
    - UNDO hold Footswitch while in Play/Dub: The last layer 
    - CLEAR hold Footswitch in Stop: **ALL** recording data
    - DELETE hold Save/Delete button, tap to confirm
    - v^ track bounce does what?
