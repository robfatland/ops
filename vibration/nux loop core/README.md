- Dispense with the concentric volume knobs: Two knobs, two functions, end of story
- Dispense with v ^ as chooser controls in any given menu, end of story
- There are now five controls to figure out plus...
    - display interpretation...
    - mode lights
    - what you can access in `config` on power on
        - Order of footswitch modes Play / Record / Overdub: Footswitch + Power
        - Factory Reset
        - Frequency compensation function??? Save/Delete + Power
    - USB connector for file transfer
    - Audio in jack
- Holding buttons (versus tap) is the key to functional access

### Those five controls

- RHYTHM (default: metronome) button: tap on/off
    - This part of the system is independent of the phrase loop recording
    - Can turn this on with a tap or by a double-tap of the TAP TEMPO button
    - Default metronome 4/4; hold TAP TEMPO to get into 3/4 vs 4/4 option, v ^ to choose
- TAP TEMPO must be lit to be active
    - Two taps is enough to establish a tempo
- Foot switch
    - Double tap is "STOP" playback / record / overdub
    - Single tap moves from Stop to a cycle: Record Play Overdub (change order using power-up process)
- Stop Modes
    - Tap to cycle through Stop / Stop-at-end-of-phrase / Stop after 10 second fadeout
        - Two of these take some time to stop
            - When stopping LED will flash
            - When flashing: Override and stop instantly by tap footswitch
    - Hold to engage Auto-record (second push to confirm)
        - Once this is engaged as `rA` note the unit is not in record mode
        - Footswitch to arm recording: Unit listens for signal to start recording
- SAVE / DELETE
    - Tap to Save: Note decimal lights up to indicate data in numerical track
        - Numerical track = Loop = Memory number...
