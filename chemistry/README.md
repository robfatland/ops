Suppose we have to start doing chemistry problems and we are presented with these two: 

26. How many mL of 0.25M KMnO4 are needed to deliver 0.00450 moles of KMnO4 during a chemical reaction? 

27. Suppose you needed to prepare a 100mL solution of 1.05M NaOH using 1.5M NaOH, distilled water, and a 100mL 
graduated cylinder. How would you do this?


A couple of observations to begin with: We need a good working definition of both **moles** and **molarity**. We also need
a good agreement on how we derive the mass of a molecule. And we need to know why they stipulated a graduated cylinder. So
this is four questions that I will answer; and after that I will come back and re-state the problems and we can hope they
will be solvable at that point. 


One mole of something is one Avogadro's number of it; which is approximately 6e23. That is 6 times ten raised to the 
twenty-third power; which is rather a lot. More accurately 6.022 but I will just use 6. 


By the way in addition to massive particles we can also have a mole of 
massless particles. In particular -- pun intended -- a mole of photons (light particles) is called an Einstein of 
photons.


Let me jump ahead to the question of the mass of a particle. Here I will treat protons and neutrons as having 
mass 1 and electrons as being massless. These are approximations. Furthermore for a given atom (fixed number
of protons) there are variable numbers of neutrons possible. These variants are called isotopes. For example 
we hear plenty about C_{12} (Carbon-12 = 6 protons + 6 neutrons) but there is a surprisingly large amount of 
C_{13} in the world as well. There is even C_{14} but this tends to fall apart after a thousand years or so. 
Point is I'm going to just take the mass of Carbon to be 12, full stop. Obviously we get these off the periodic
table. What are the units? Answer: Atomic mass units, where one proton has a mass of 1 amu. This I find is now
indicated by the letter **u** as in '1 Hydrogen atoms weighs 1 u'. A long time ago these were called Daltons and
my chemistry friends still use Da occasionally.
