## A couple of chemistry problems


Suppose we have to start doing chemistry problems and we are presented with: 

26. How many mL of 0.25M KMnO4 are needed to deliver 0.00450 moles of KMnO4 during a chemical reaction? 


27. Suppose you needed to prepare a 100mL solution of 1.05M NaOH using 1.5M NaOH, distilled water, and a 100mL 
graduated cylinder. How would you do this?


***Before I begin working on this let me remark that I write using both markdown and LaTeX. Markdown afaik does not
support subscript / superscript; so I use LaTeX. Therefore C with a subscript of 12 could be written C_{12} and H 
with a superscript + might be written H^+ or H^{+}. Also a number written as 6e23 is read as 'six times ten
raised to the 23rd power'. That's how to translate some of my notation.***


### Define four ideas


A couple of observations to begin with: We need a good working definition of both **moles** and **molarity**. We also need
a good agreement on how we derive the **mass** of an atom or molecule. And we need to know why they stipulated a 
**graduated cylinder**. So this is four questions that I will answer. After that I will come back to and re-state 
the problems where we will hope they will be more tractable. 


One mole of something is one Avogadro's number of it; which is approximately 6e23 particles. That is 6 times ten raised 
to the twenty-third power; which is rather a lot. More accurately 6.022 but I will just use 6. It is interesting to
consider how much space a mole of Honda civics would take up in a cubical box.


By the way in addition to massive particles we can also have a mole of 
massless particles. In particular -- pun intended -- a mole of photons (light particles) is called an Einstein of 
photons, still 6e23 of them.


Let me jump to the mass of a particle. Here I will treat protons and neutrons as having 
mass 1 and electrons as being massless. These are approximations. Furthermore for a given atom (fixed number
of protons) there are variable numbers of neutrons possible. These variants are called isotopes. For example 
we hear plenty about C_{12} (Carbon-12 = 6 protons + 6 neutrons) but there is a surprisingly large amount of 
C_{13} in the world as well. There is even C_{14} but this tends to fall apart after a thousand years or so. 
Point is I'm going to just take the mass of Carbon to be 12, full stop. We see atomic masses on the periodic
table with usually some extra digits. I'm just going to round to the nearest integer. 


Ok but what are these units? Answer: Atomic mass units; where one proton has a mass of 1. This unit (I find) 
is now indicated by the letter **u** as in '1 Hydrogen atoms has a mass of 1 u'. Originally these were called 
Daltons and my chemistry friends still say Daltons so I will too. Daltons = atomic mass units (Da = u).


Now we can connect moles and Daltons via kilograms. One Da is 1.66e-27kg, an actual mass. One mole of Hydrogen 
weighs less than one mole of carbon because moles are 'number of particles'. So moles do not translate to 
kilograms until you say moles of *what*. A mole of Hydrogen atoms -- each one weighing one Dalton -- weighs
6e23 (particles per mole) times 1 (Daltons per particle) times 1e-27 (kilograms per Dalton) = 0.001 kg 
or informally we say that is one gram. 


Ok so that's why Avogadro's number was chosen to be that goofy number 6.022e23: So that "a mole of something 
= its weight translated to grams". Therefore: Every time we see a mole of something and it has a molecular 
formula we can tot up all the atoms in that formula by their mass in Daltons; then convert that to grams;
and then loudly proclaim "this many grams of this stuff is one mole of it". For example in problem 26
we see KMnO_4 which is one Potassium (K) at 39 Da, one Manganese at 55 Da, and 4 Oxygen each at 16 Da for
a total of 158 Da. So 158 grams of KMnO_4 is one mole of it. 


Now I have answered two of the four questions: What is a mole and how do we deal with the masses of molecules. 


Next let's dispense with the graduated cylinder. These do not have a lot of spare capacity above the top
line so a 100mL graduated cyclinder can be taken to hold only 100mL of liquid, not more. Therefore any 
solution-building we do can't exceed 100mL in the "bucket" at any one time. Which reminds me of gallon 
puzzles so let me give you one of those to work out while I go make sure I have a good working definition
of 'molarity'. 


Suppose you have two beakers that are not graduated. Let's say they were held back by Professor Erlenmeyer.
One holds precisely 900mL and the other holds 400mL. Using a spigot of water flowing into a sink in your
chemistry lab: How would you obtain 300mL of water?
